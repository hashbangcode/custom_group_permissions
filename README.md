# Drupal Custom Group Permissions Module

Compatible with Drupal 9.5.x|10.x and Group version 3.x.

For more information about the code here please see [Drupal 10: Adding Custom Permissions To Groups](https://www.hashbangcode.com/article/drupal-10-adding-custom-permissions-groups).

This module is intended to show how to add permissions and access rules to the
Group module. As there are a number of different ways of adding permissions
this module will inherently cause contradictions with itself.

**Note!** Do not use this module in production, it is for educational purposes
only! Feel free to take the code here and use it in your own modules, but please
do not just activate this module and expect it to work.
